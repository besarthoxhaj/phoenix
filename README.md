## What?
A react-native template using redux. It covers all functionality needed to create a basic iOS app, like:
- routing system
- modal system
- log system
- notification system
- high level http request system
- global error handling system
- highly declarative and testable
and more!

## How?
Through redux.

## Why?
React native is relatively young, but really powerful. For this reason many people are using it, but there are not real best practices and a clear way to test it (reliably).
This is our small and humble attempt to set some best practices.
